## üëã About Me:

**A Certified Chemist that jumped into the Sales portal ended at Software Engineering**

You might wonder how I went from chemistry to software engineering, and my answer is simple: life. I was passionate about two things growing up‚Äîchemicals and Tumblr. Chemistry fascinated me because I wanted to understand how things worked, like why some chemicals remove grease and why you shouldn't mix them with bleach. Tumblr, on the other hand, let me express myself with visuals and tags, though I didn't realize I was coding back then. Years later, learning HTML/CSS felt familiar because I had done similar things on Tumblr. I initially pursued chemistry, as I had an advantage with an IB diploma, but sales was just a temporary financial solution. After a pause due to COVID, I returned to coding. Now, I‚Äôm fluent not only in chemistry and sales but also in programming‚ÄîJavaScript, Python, React, Flask, and more. My journey wasn‚Äôt a typical career switch; it's the blend of analytical skills and tech innovation that applies across various fields.

## üñ•Ô∏è Still want to know why software engineering?:


I love solving problems that seem simple but no one has tackled yet. I've always considered myself a jack-of-all-trades, proud of knowing how to do just about everything, whether at home or work. I enjoy learning new skills, and software engineering lets me combine my experiences as an Operations Manager, Clerk-Trainer, Chemist, and Sales Manager into the applications I create. It enhances my skills, gives me purpose, and lets me be the change I want to see. The joy of building solutions from my own ideas, using just my hands, fingertips, and brain, is unmatched. Through software engineering, I help companies and individuals solve problems and be the person I aspire to be.

## üíûÔ∏è Personal Interests:

I like to call myself the second coming of Quentin Tarantino. I swear the scripts I have written are Oscar worthy material. I typically like to write about meta-fictional narratives. This is more of a quiet hobby though. My loud and proud hobby is my love for curating the perfect playlist for almost every occasion - whether it is a wedding or a having a day off in the middle of the week. Name the occasion and I will more than likely have a playlist for it. Besides doing my hobbies I enjoy engaging with other men through my non-profit - Men Cry Too - helping men assess their mental health and seek help/ guidance and provide a place for me to speak/ feel comfortable.

## ü¶Ñ Looking for Unique?:

Where I shine brighter than a flawed conditional (if-else) statement is in developing solutions that prioritize user efficiency and experience. I typically take the road less traveled in the developer way which is writing the code to be as responsible as it is robust.

My unique sense of humor, passion for clean code, and a keen eye for user-centric design make me not just a developer, but a narrator. A narrator who translates the needs and wants of the digital realm into reality. If you're looking for someone who can navigate the complexities of software engineering with a smile and probably too many Ted Lasso, One Piece, Harry Potter, or Pulp Fiction references, then look no further. I'm your coder, ready to tackle the next big challenge with a keyboard in one hand and coffee in the other‚Äîbecause why code without coffee?

I wanted to push myself to learn more about DOM manipulation and build an application from scratch instead of cloning. I built the backend with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, the frontend with React and used AWS S3 to store images. I plan to continue working on this project to add more features!       |Groups,<br> Events,<br> Profile,<br> Posts,<br> Tags, <br> Comments, <br> Likes|![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/flask-%23000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white)![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLAlchemy-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=SQLAlchemy&logoColor=white)![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-%23593d88.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redux&logoColor=white)![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alembic-%23F79A32.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=alembic&logoColor=white) ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_S3-569A31?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-s3&logoColor=white)![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Figma-F24E1E?logo=figma&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge" height="28" alt="figma logo"  /> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Canva-00C4CC?logo=canva&logoColor=black&style=for-the-badge" height="28" alt="canva logo"  /> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Markdown-000000?logo=markdown&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge" height="28" alt="markdown logo"  />|
