## üëã About Me

**A Certified Chemist that jumped into the Sales portal ended at Software Engineering**

You are probably wondering how I started off at chemistry and ended at software engineering, and my response to you is Life. In all seriousness though, I only had two passions in my adolescent days - Playing with household chemicals and Tumblr. I started off at chemistry because I wanted to know how chemicals worked - what about that chemical removes grease?, the why of why am I not allowed to mix it with bleach? Tumblr gave me passion because I was allowed to express myself how I wanted to express myself - with visuals and a network of tags. I did not know I was coding on Tumblr until I actually started coding a little over a year ago. When I was learning HTML/CSS I was like "oh I did something similar to this on Tumblr when I was younger". I started at chemistry first because I already had a leverage on attaining a chemistry degree due to being an International Baccalaureate (IB) scholar in high school. To sum up sales in a sentence, it was something to hold me over financially until until I completed getting my engineering degree; covid was a thing and so I halted and convinced myself to stop coding and go back to chemistry. Fast foward - here I am, not only fluent in chemistry and sales but also coding - JavaScript, Python, React, Flask, the list goes on. The journey from chemistry to software engineering is not just some old career switch, its the concoction of analytical talents with technological innovation that can be applied within any space.

## üñ•Ô∏è Still want to know why software engineering?

I enjoy providing solutions to issues that seem easy to fix but no one has yet to fix them. I have always considered myself a jack-of-all-trades and took pride in pretty much being the one who knew how to do everything whether at home or at work. More importantly, I always wanted to know how to do all the tasks needed to be done at work, like why not learn something new? After learning a lot of skills and having many ideas. Software Engineering allows me to combine my skills learned from being an Operations Manager, Clerk-Trainer, Chemist, and a Sales Manager into however many applications I want to create. It does not allow skills to go to waste, it ENHANCES them. It gives me purpose, it gives me an outlet to be myself, it helps me follow my motto of being the change I want to see, it helps me solve some of the issues I want to solve. The joy and excitement it brings me to create a an application that can do whatever you want it to do. And this is all from the palm of my hands and my fingertips, most importantly, MY BRAIN! Software Engineering allows me to create and locate the resources I need to assist companies and individuals attain solutions to their problems. It helps me be the person I want to be - being the change I want to see.

## üíûÔ∏è Personal Interests

I like to call myself the second coming of Quentin Tarantino. I swear the scripts I have written are Oscar worthy material. I typically like to write about meta-fictional narratives. This is more of a quiet hobby though. My loud and proud hobby is my love for curating the perfect playlist for almost every occasion - whether it is a wedding or a having a day off in the middle of the week. Name the occasion and I will more than likely have a playlist for it. Besides doing my hobbies I enjoy engaging with other men through my non-profit - Men Cry Too - helping men assess their mental health and seek help/ guidance and provide a place for me to speak/ feel comfortable.

## ü¶Ñ Looking for Unique?

Where I shine brighter than a flawed conditional (if-else) statement is in developing solutions that prioritize user efficiency and experience. I typically take the road less traveled in the developer way which is writing the code to be as responsible as it is robust.

My unique sense of humor, passion for clean code, and a keen eye for user-centric design make me not just a developer, but a narrator. A narrator who translates the needs and wants of the digital realm into reality. If you're looking for someone who can navigate the complexities of software engineering with a smile and probably too many Ted Lasso, One Piece, Harry Potter, or Pulp Fiction references, then look no further. I'm your coder, ready to tackle the next big challenge with a keyboard in one hand and coffee in the other‚Äîbecause why code without coffee?
